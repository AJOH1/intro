    <h2 style="color:azure;">My name is Ekeh Michael, and I hail from the vibrant city of Enugu, Nigeria. <br>
        My passion for coding ignited during my junior years of education, igniting a spark that has continued to burn brightly ever since.<br>
        The allure of crafting digital solutions, the thrill of problem-solving through code, and the limitless potential of technology captured my imagination. <br>
        I immersed myself in the world of programming, dedicating countless hours to learning and experimenting.<br>
        As I journey forward, I aspire to become a skilled and respected software developer. I dream of venturing overseas, where I can collaborate with talented individuals from around the world and contribute to groundbreaking projects.<br>
         With each line of code I write, I am one step closer to realizing my ambitions.</h2>
